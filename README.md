# Introduction

This package provide **fast** and **accurate** machine learning models for biochemical applications.
Especially, we support very high-dimensional models with sparse inputs, *e.g.*, millions of features and millions of compounds.
- The general documentation can be found [here](docs/main.md).
- Documentation about how to retrain a pretrained model can be found [here](docs/local_trunk.md).
- Documentation about how to profile GPU memory usage and use mixed precision can be found [here](docs/memprofile.md).
